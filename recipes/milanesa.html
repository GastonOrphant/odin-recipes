    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Probably you never heard about this recipe, but milanesas are one of the best ways to eat steaks of res, or chicken.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <li>2 large eggs, or more if needed</li>
    <li>40 saltine crackers, smashed</li>
    <li>4 thin slices of boneless round steak</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack eggs in a medium bowl and beat slightly with a fork or whisk. Set aside. Place smashed crackers on a plate big enough for the steak.</li>
        <li>Season steak with salt and pepper and soak in the beaten egg. Transfer to the smashed crackers and cover both sides with the crackers using a spoon; you can press a little bit with the spoon so that the crackers stick better.</li>
        <li>Heat a frying pan over medium heat and add enough oil to cover the bottom half of the steaks. Cook 2 steaks in the hot oil until crackers have turned light golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn and continue to cook until golden and meat is no longer pink, 4 to 5 minutes more. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. Repeat with remaining steaks.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Cook's notes:</h2>
    <p>The normal recipe for this is with bread crumbs. But the crackers give a crispy taste and look. 
        Don't make dust out of the crackers. Leave some cracker bits so the Milanesa will be more crispy.</p>
    <p>   You'll need round steaks that are about 1/4 inch thick.</p>
